It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.","description":"Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). \\nFor example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].  Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.  \\nYou must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.","platform":"oj","code":"\\nvar search = function (nums, target) { \\n    let low = 0; \\n    let high = nums.length - 1; \\n    while (low <= high) { \\n        // 1) Find middle point mid = (l + h)/2 \\n        let mid = parseInt(low + ((high - low) / 2)); \\n        // 2) If key is present at middle point, return mid. \\n        if (nums[mid] == target) { \\n            return mid; \\n        } \\n        // 3) Else If arr[l..mid] is sorted \\n        if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) { \\n            //     a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[l] \\n            //        to arr[mid], recur for arr[l..mid]. \\n            if (nums[low] <= target && nums[mid] >= target) { \\n                high = mid - 1; \\n            } \\n            //     b) Else recur for arr[mid+1..h] \\n            else { \\n                low = mid + 1; \\n            } \\n        } \\n        // 4) Else (arr[mid+1..h] must be sorted) \\n        else { \\n            //     a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[mid+1] \\n            //        to arr[h], recur for arr[mid+1..h]. \\n            if (nums[mid] <= target && nums[high] >= target) { \\n                low = mid + 1; \\n            } \\n            // b) Else recur for arr[l..mid]  \\n            else { \\n                high = mid - 1; \\n            } \\n        } \\n    } \\n    return -1; \\n};","solved":true,"isFav":true,"isPubic":true,"userId":"62d649d6eac7e26fd7bd50e6"}]
